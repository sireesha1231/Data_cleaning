Determine the sentiment of each tweet:-

Created a sentiment dictionary. Split lines in the sentiment_file by tab as it is a tab-delimited file. Set the first index of the line as the phrase and the second index as the score. Strip the score value of any white spaces. Add the phrase and floating values of the score into the sentiment dictionary. Initially the score is set to 0 and then incremented later on. Convert all text to lower case for ease. Split the phrase into words and check for the sentiment score of each word and add it to the overall score of the phrase to get text_score. Print the phrase and its score next to it.
